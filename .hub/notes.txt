The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you 
to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, 
visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and 
transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data 
visualization, machine learning, and much more.

JupyterHub brings the power of notebooks to groups of users. It gives users 
access to computational environments and resources without burdening the 
users with installation and maintenance tasks. Users - including students, 
researchers, and data scientists - can get their work done in their own 
workspaces on shared resources which can be managed efficiently by system
administrators.

JupyterHub runs in the cloud or on your own hardware, and makes it possible 
to serve a pre-configured data science environment to any user in the world. 
It is customizable and scalable, and is suitable for small and large teams, 
academic courses, and large-scale infrastructure.

AgileStacks JupyterHub Notebook application template bootstraps an user 
workspace within JupyterHub using the API.
Additionally it creates a Git repository where it places sample 
Jupyter notebooks and a Dockerfile that can be extended and rebuilt
with additional Pythom libraries for machine learning.
Users can easily navigate to their Git repo and Jupyter workspace 
using links provided in the applications section on the Controlplane.
