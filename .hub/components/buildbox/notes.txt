Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level 
virtualization, also known as "containerization". It was first 
released in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc. Docker is used to 
run software packages called "containers".

Docker unlocks the potential of your organization by giving 
developers and IT the freedom to build, manage and secure business-critical 
applications without the fear of technology or infrastructure lock-in.

By combining its industry-leading container engine technology, an 
enterprise-grade container platform and world-class services, Docker 
enables you to bring traditional and cloud native applications built on 
Windows Server, Linux and mainframe into an automated and secure supply
chain, advancing dev to ops collaboration and reducing time to value.
