GitHub Inc. is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. 
It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed 
version control and source code management functionality of Git as well 
as adding its own features.

To understand GitHub, you must first have an understanding of Git. 
Git is an open-source version control system that was started by Linus 
Trovalds—the same person who created Linux. Git is similar to other 
version control systems—Subversion, CVS, and Mercurial to name a few.

So, Git is a version control system, but what does that mean? When 
developers create something (an app, for example), they make constant 
changes to the code, releasing new versions up to and after the first 
official (non-beta) release.

Version control systems keep these revisions straight, storing the 
modifications in a central repository. This allows developers to easily 
collaborate, as they can download a new version of the software, make 
changes, and upload the newest revision. Every developer can see 
these new changes, download them, and contribute.
